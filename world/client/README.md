_**Note:** The names for the above packet commands are real names taken from the PS2 Beta debug information/symbols. Packets that are marked as `(UnknownName)` either did not have a named command in the PS2 beta, or they were added after the PS2 beta. Only real valid names are listed regardless if the packet purpose is understood._
