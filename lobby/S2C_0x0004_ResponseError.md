## Description

The server response packet sent to the client when a previous request failed to be completed.

## Packet Layout

```cpp
struct packet_t
{
    //
    // Packet Header
    //

    uint32_t        packet_size;                // PS2: packet_size
    uint32_t        terminator;                 // PS2: terminator
    uint32_t        command;                    // PS2: command
    uint8_t         identifer[16];              // PS2: identifer

    //
    // Packet Data
    //

    uint32_t        unknown0000;                // PS2: (Unknown; not used.)
    uint32_t        err_code;                   // PS2: (unknown)
};
```

## Packet Fields

### packet_size, terminator, command, identifer

_These fields are part of the packet header._

_You can find more information about the header fields here: [**Header**](/lobby/Header.md)_

### unknown0000

_Unknown._

_This field is never referenced within the client. It was always observed to be `0x10`, but the actual value or its purpose is unknown._

### err_code

_The error code returned from the server._

_The client does not have a specific handler for this packet. It instead only reads the error code into the current work objects `err_code` field. Thus, the field has been named `err_code` here as well._

## Example Packet

```
0000h: 24 00 00 00 49 58 46 46 04 00 00 00 48 41 53 48  $...IXFF....HASH
0010h: 48 41 53 48 48 41 53 48 48 41 53 48 10 00 00 00  HASHHASHHASH....
0020h: 39 01 00 00                                      9...
```
